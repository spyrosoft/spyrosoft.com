      %p Finding a way for browsers to render images quickly was very complicated. The first version printed each pixel as it was generated. This ultimately took more time than just printing the entire thing at once. An attempt was made to use C on the server side, however it ended up being even slower because of network latency. Additionally shifting the computation load to the server makes it very difficult to scale. The use of Web Workers cut the rendering time down massively.
      %p There is no good way to precompute the data. Techniques for caching just don't work. The database would end up consuming too much disk space, for one thing.
