# Building Secure Websites
------

**What Does Secure Mean?**

In the context of a secure connection, secure means https appears in front of the domain:

When https is present your browser sends information in a secret way across the internet. The information is secure in the sense that even if people on the network are able to scan the information while it is on transit they will not be able to tell what the contents are.

In the context of building a secure website, security means allowing only those who are authorized to make modificatiions to the website. The technologies used to build the majority of the websites on the internet today are not very secure. For example, in my experience 3 in every 40 WordPress websites become compromised every 5 years.

**Why Is Security Important?**

A compromised website damages the image of the company and the search engine ranks of the website. It is expensive and time consuming to fix. Sometimes data is lost permanently.

**Why Do So Many Websites Use Insecure Technology?**

That is a great question. The short answer is: In a perfect world they would not. The long answer is: [Worse Is Better](https://blog.codinghorror.com/worse-is-better/).

**How Do Websites Become Compromised?**

The Website Security blog post lists a few [techniques used to compromise websites](/blog/website-security.html#techniques-used-to-compromise-your-website).

**Why Is SpyroSoft Different?**

You may have heard the term Full Stack Web Developer before. This term means handling everything from installing and configuring the operating system to making a website look nice.

If it were easy to do, this would be fine.

**What Are Some Secure Options?**

_Standard Websites And Blogs As Well As Ecommerce_
* [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/pricing)  
_Built For Ecommerce_

**But I Want To Use WordPress.**

That makes sense. The enormous community around WordPress has churned out software to handle just about anything. However be forewarned that what WordPress has in community it lacks in scalability, maintainability, security, speed, and modularity. If your website requires any of these, WordPress is probably not the right fit.
