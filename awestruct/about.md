## Security Techniques

* Setting up Linux servers with no user passwords, keys only.
* Dropping all packets other than http and https.
* Using [KnockKnock](https://moxie.org/software/knockknock/) by Moxie Marlinspike to port knock open the ssh port for my ip address for 30 seconds and close again behind me.
* Installing the absolute minimum amount of software possible.
* Using HAProxy, Golang and PostgreSQL to protect against attacks on software such as Apache, PHP and MySQL.

## History

My profession began in 2008 as a designer using Photoshop and Illustrator. I have since moved from the top to the bottom of the developer stack. These days my greatest strength is in creating interactive web applications from the ground up with a focus on intelligent user interfaces. This means that when there is only one thing that the user could possibly want under a certain set of conditions it happens automatically. Additionally the user experience is optimized by organizing the most common actions in the most obvious places.

I live in sunny Santa Cruz, California. My expertise is in Golang, Zurb Foundation, SASS, Shell Scripting, Steel Bank Common Lisp, SVG, SQL, XUL, Processing, AppleScript, C, PHP, and Java.

I also gravitate towards ecommerce websites. My experience varies from Shopify to Stripe Checkout to Magento.

I am a member of the [NextSpace Santa Cruz](http://nextspace.us/) community and [Santa Cruz Geeks](http://santacruzgeeks.com/)

I fit best in projects where quality is the ultimate goal. I am a firm believer in the Clean Code movement.
