      <p>This is a list of the text editors I have used to write and edit code. How could this list be so long? Every time I venture out to try a new editor the result is the same. The editor has somehow failed me. To this day I continue my search for the one editor to rule them all.</p>
      
      <p>It is maybe due to the fact that all of the effort of editor creators is spread over so many different editors that no single editor is able to sprint ahead. The biggest issues in particular preventing editors from living up to my standards are (in no particular order):</p>
      
      <h3 id="customizability">Customizability</h3>
      
      <p>Most editors have at least one or two nice features that the rest tend not to have. Shiny needs to be able to absorb any and all of this functionality in a beginner-friendly, straight forward, modular way. This means a few things:</p>
      
      <p>1) The scripting language must be able to call any and all functions built into the editor
      2) Once this functionality has been created it must be exceedingly easy to share it with other people and the community
      3) The community must be able to easily contribute back to the submitted code
      4) The community must be large enough for it even to matter</p>
      
      <p>The settings also need to be set as optimally as possible right from the get-go. A good way to accomplish this is to accept anonymous user feedback on how their settings are - paying attention to how the default settings have been changed and evolving the default settings over time based on popularity.</p>
      
      <p>Some things I have never seen done before that I would really like to see:</p>
      
      <p>1) A set of default settings the user can choose from when setting up the editor for the first time. For example it could contain settings similar to other editors or platforms
      2) Portable configuration settings which follow the user around and remain up-to-date. Editor settings do not contain sensitive information - there is no reason to make them entirely public for everyone. On the same note why not make it easy to switch between different configuration settings at run time, maybe via a keyboard shortcut. This way two people could do extreme programming and still have highly customized configuration settings. This could be through a central server supported by the editor (traffic would be minimal) or github or something to this effect.</p>
      
      <h3 id="low-entry-barrier">Low Entry Barrier</h3>
      
      <p>The editor must be as straight forward as notepad.exe. The fancy underlying functionality must not get in the way of the bare minimum basics. Ever. Anything extra should be added on top, not the other way around.</p>
      
      <h3 id="tabs-and-spaces">Tabs And Spaces</h3>
      
      <p>One of the biggest issues by far with almost all editors is their spectacular inability to deal with indentation. Autodetection must work as flawlessly as possible. Files with mixed tabs and spaces should prompt the user when opened for normalization. Formatting entire projects should be a snap.</p>
      
      <h3 id="code-formatting">Code Formatting</h3>
      
      <p>Similar to indentation code formatting functionality should be thorough and work mostly automatically. The user needs to be able to customize the code formatting in any way. Previously used code formatting settings should be available via save/load.</p>
      
      <p>A setting should exist to format the code whenever it is saved.</p>
      
      <h3 id="language-awareness">Language Awareness</h3>
      
      <p>Interacting with the code as it is written is essential. Why this trend has not picked up in a much bigger way is beyond me. This means a number of things. Ideally there would (optionally) be a connection to the programming language itself. This may require some setup so streamlining the setup for the user is important.</p>
      
      <p>Web programming should integrate directly with a browser, front end and back end. Automation techniques similar to macros or selenium are a huge plus. Hooks should be available for key events and file save events, depending on what the programmer needs and how heavy the page load is.</p>
      
      <p>Turning language awareness up or down while programming should be a snap. Sometimes a programmer just wants to hack and doesn't need constant reminders that the code isn't working yet.</p>
      
      <h3 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
      
      <p>The less programmers needs to move their hands the healthier their hands are and the more effective they are at working. To this end chording should be introduced as a core concept very early on. This removes the need for pressing control, alt, meta, etc. all the time.</p>
      
      <h3 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h3>
      
      <p>Whenever someone creates new functionality to share with the rest of the community, it would help everyone if a working interactive tutorial shipped with it. This should be built into the framework from the very beginning rendering the help section actually be helpful.</p>
      
      <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
      
      <p>This is just a short list. Quite a bit of this is somewhat esoteric and won't be used by everyone. There are lots of things that other people want out of their editors which aren't listed here.</p>
      
      <p>The whole point is: editors should do what users want.</p>
