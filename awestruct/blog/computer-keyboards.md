## Computer Keyboards
------

Keyboards are astonishing. Technology has come such an unfathomably long way. Yet computers still ship with the same keyboard shape and layout that was invented for the typewriter in the 1800's.

### 20% Of Your Fingers Are Dedicated To The Space Bar

One of the strangest things of all is that both thumbs are dedicated to the space bar. In general, the user only uses one thumb to press the space bar at all. This means that 10% of the user's fingers aren't doing anything at all. Ever. Wat?

### Offset Keys

Initially keys were offset because keyboards were mechanical. This forces some of your fingers, such as your left hand index finger into uncomfortable positions when typing the key directly above. Why are all keyboards not layed out in straight grids?

### Qwerty

Qwerty if you don't already know is the first sequence of characters on the top row of the keyboard, hence its name.

Imagine this: Leaving the number keys where they are, if you pulled all of the character keys off of a regular keyboard, put them in a bag, shook it up, and placed them all back on at random, it would more often than not be a more efficient layout.

### How Hard Is It To Switch?

"But I already know qwerty. Besides, what if I want to use someone else's computer?"

You go right ahead and do whatever you want. Aren't you just a bit curious though?

In response to the first point in particular, of course it will take effort to learn a new keyboard layout. Which would you rather?

1. Spend some extra effort now and reap the benefits every single day for the rest of your life.
2. Continue at no additional effort in the short term and lose out on the benefits every single day for the rest of your life.

Let's say you are 25 and you live to the ripe old age of 75. Assuming that you don't use computers on the weekend (yeah right) we are looking at (365x5/7)x50 days. That comes out to a little more than 13,000 days. If you gain something, even a little bit of something, for each of those days it adds up very quickly.

In response to the point regarding using other people's computers I can personally attest as someone who went cold turkey on Qwerty in 2007 to how little this actually comes up. Assuming the first point is true and you already know qwerty, learning a second layout is like learning a new language. You will always still be able to use qwerty.

It took me about three months to master the new layout. This is apparently much longer than usual. Those who I know that switched took much less time than I did.

Most people assume that the only reason to switch is to attain faster typing speed. I find that my typing speed is pretty much the same as it was before switching; it is mostly dependent on how fast I am thinking about what I'm typing. The only time typing speed really comes up for me is when I'm transcribing printed or written words to the computer which is fairly rare. The more important result of switching is the increase of comfort and accuracy. The ammount of backspace presses really does decrease quite a bit. The comfort will speak for itself when you're in flow (says a programmer, but I think this affects normal people too).

### Alternative Layout

I recommend learning Colemak. It is supported out of the box on all operating systems.

I use the Dvorak layout. If you've heard of alternative layouts in the past, this is probably the one you've heard of. I recommend Colemak over it because [Colemak is a little bit better](/tools/compare-qwerty-to-dvorak-to-colemak.html).
