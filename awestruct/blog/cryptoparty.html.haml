    %h2 Basics of Cryptography
  %section
    %h3 Throughout history, these two things have been needed by humans:
    %ol
      %li The need to share information
      %li The need to protect the information they are sharing
  %section
    %ol
      %li
        Comes from the combination of (Greek) words
        %strong Krypto
        (hidden) and
        %strong graphene
        (writing)
      %img{src: 'http://www.knomebook.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Spartan_Cryptography2.jpg'}
      %small The Spartans wrote on a narrow strip of parchment wrapped around a cylindrical log (called a Scytale) to encrypt messages
  %section
    %ol
      %li
        Can be defined as:
        %span.italics The art and science of concealing messages to introduce secrecy in information security
      %li
        From the Oxford dictionary:
        %span.italics The art of writing or solving codes
  %section
    %h3 Caesar's Cipher
    %ol
      %li Used by the ancient Romans
      %li To encode "shift" forward the alphabet by a constant offset
      %li To decode "shift" back
      %img{src: 'https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1L0BHN4Qr0s/UieG2he-AOI/AAAAAAAAAGg/Hop2r1Lg0yo/s1600/caesar.png'}

    %h3 Modern Cryptography
    %strong Two types:
    %ol
      %li
        Classic
        %ul
          %li Manipulates letters and digits directly
          %li Based on 'Security through obscurity'
      %li
        Modern
        %ul
          %li Operates on binary seqences
          %li Relies on publicly known mathematical algorithms and computational difficulty
  %section
    %h3 Security of Cryptography
    %p Cryptography provides four services:
    %ol
      %li Confidentiality - protects your information from an unauthorized person
      %li Data Integrity - determines if your message/communication has been tampered with
      %li Authentication - confirms that a message was sent by a known and verified sender
      %li Non-repudiation - ensures an entity cannot refuse ownership of a previous action

    %h2 Secure Mobile Messaging with Signal
  %section
    %h3 What is Signal?
    %p
      %img{:src => '/images/presentations/signal.png'}
    %ul
      %li Signal is a secure communication platform from Open Whisper Systems
      %li Provides a secure, easy to use alternative to calling, texting, and video chat
      %li Successor to RedPhone and TextSecure
      %li Uses data connection instead of phone network
      %li Signal seamlessly integrates with phone/SMS for the rest of your contacts
  %section
    %p
      %img{:src => '/images/presentations/signal-conversation-list.png'}
  %section
    %h3
      How do I use Signal to communicate?
    %ul
      %li Instead of calling your contact, try a Signal voice call
      %li Instead of sending a text message, send it with Signal. Group chat is supported as well
      %li You can also video chat (no FaceTime, Allo)
      %li You can still share pictures and other media
      %li For contacts without Signal, fallback to the phone network
      %li Invite your friends to use Signal too!
  %section
    %h3 How does Signal protect my communications?
    %ul
      %li Provides end-to-end encryption and authentication for text, audio, and video chat
      %li Uses the Double Ratchet algorithm, developed by Trevor Perrin and Moxie Marlinspike based on trusted crypto primitives like Curve25519, AES-256, and HMAC-SHA256
      %li Bunch of other cool privacy features like disappearing messages, key change alerts and verification, and local message db encryption
      %li Leaves less metadata than using the phone network or other communication apps
  %section
    %h3 Where can I get Signal?
    %ul
      %li Signal is available for mobile in the Google Play store and the Apple App Store
      %li After installing, set Signal as your default SMS application for ease of use
      %li Signal is also available for desktop as a Chrome app

    %h2 Internet Anonymity with Tor and i2p
  %section
    %h3 What are Tor and i2p?
    %p
      %img{:src => '/images/presentations/tor.png', style: 'vertical-align: middle;'}
      %img{:src => '/images/presentations/itoopie.png', style: 'vertical-align: middle;'}
  %section
    %h3 What are Tor and i2p?
    %ul
      %li Tor is an anonymous internet proxy that allows users to use the Internet
      %li Invented at the Naval Research Lab, used by technologists, law enforcement, intelligence services, political activists, and more
      %li Tor also allows access to onion services, accessible only over Tor
      %li i2p, the Invisible Internet Project allows access to an alternative anonymous "Internet"
      %li Initially released in 2003, maintained mostly by pseudonymous developers
  %section
    %h3 How do Tor and i2p help?
    %ul
      %li Prevents a website or server from knowing your real IP address
      %li Prevents your ISP from watching what you do online
      %li But they do know that you're using Tor (without the use of bridges and the obfuscated pluggable transports) or i2p
      %li Internet anonymity promotes democracy, free speech and free thought by allowing users to research and express themselves without fear
  %section
    %h3 How do Tor and i2p work?
    %ul
      %li Tor uses "onion routing," multiple layers of encryption in a series of relays through a mix network
      %li By default, a client tunnels through 3 encrypted hops. Each node only knows the next and previous address
      %li A Tor node can be a middle relay, exit node, or onion service
      %li i2p uses "Garlic routing," as multiple packets can be encapsulated into a single i2p packet
  %section
    %h3 Differences between Tor and i2p

  %section
    %h3 Using Tor and i2p as a client
    %ul
      %li Tor Browser Bundle
      %li Avoid fingerprinting by blending in to the crowd
      %li Tor daemon and proxy configuration
      %li Useful for CLI tools and other software. See: torsocks(1), proxychains(1)
      %li Tails Live CD or USB that includes Tor and i2p (for now, v2.11)
      %li In-memory operating system, wiped on shutdown
  %section
    %h3 Running an Onion Service
    %ul
      %li An onion service allows a server to be accessible over a special .onion address
      %li Configure the HiddenServiceDir and HiddenServicePort directives in the torrc
      %li Security considerations
      %li Misconfigurations: disable server-status page
      %li Vulnerabilities: command injection, server exploits
      %li Timing attacks: don't run another service, don't run a relay
  %section
    %h3 Running a relay, exit node / router
    %ul
      %li If you'd like to support the Tor network, you can run a relay or exit node
      %li
        To run a Tor relay, configure your ORPort and ExitPolicy. For middle relay only,
        %code reject *:*
      %li If you run an exit node, you may get some strange traffic originating from your address
      %li You can filter most traffic that would attract attention by allowing only HTTPS (443)
      %li Alternatively, be prepared to explain what Tor is, or have a lawyer to do so
      %li Note: with i2p, you're a relay by default

      %li Also referred to as "Secure Sockets Layer" or "SSL"
  %section
    %h3 How Does it Work?
    %ul
      %li The communication between two devices is encrypted using a shared secret
      %li The shared secret is only known to the devices communicating

    %h3 Quantum changes everything
    %ul
      %li Quantum breaks common cryptography
      %li Quantum enables new better cryptography
  %section
    %p There are two types of traditional cryptography
    %ul
      %li Symmetric
      %li Asymmetric
  %section
    %h3 Symmetric
    %ul
      %li Encrypt and decrypt keys are the same
      %li Key exchange is hard
      %li Typically very fast
      %li Used for encrypting data
  %section
    %h3 Asymmetric
    %ul
      %li Encrypt and decrypt keys are different
      %li Typically very slow
      %li Mostly used for encrypting symmetric encryption keys
  %section
    %h3 Common Asymmetric Encryption
    %ul
      %li
        %em RSA
      %li Depends on the assumption that factoring a product of two very large prime numbers is hard
      %li
        %em Diffie–Hellman/ElGamal
      %li Depends on the assumption that the discrete log problem is hard
  %section
