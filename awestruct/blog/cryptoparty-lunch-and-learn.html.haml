    %h2 Basics of Cryptography
  %section
    %h3 Throughout history, these two things have been needed by humans:
    %ol
      %li The need to share information
      %li The need to protect the information they are sharing
  %section
    %ol
      %li
        Comes from the combination of (Greek) words
        %strong Krypto
        (hidden) and
        %strong graphene
        (writing)
      %img{src: 'http://www.knomebook.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Spartan_Cryptography2.jpg'}
      %small The Spartans wrote on a narrow strip of parchment wrapped around a cylindrical log (called a Scytale) to encrypt messages
  %section
    %ol
      %li
        Can be defined as:
        %span.italics The art and science of concealing messages to introduce secrecy in information security
      %li
        From the Oxford dictionary:
        %span.italics The art of writing or solving codes
  %section
    %h3 Caesar's Cipher
    %ol
      %li Used by the ancient Romans
      %li To encode "shift" forward the alphabet by a constant offset
      %li To decode "shift" back

    %h3 Modern Cryptography
    %strong Two types:
    %ol
      %li
        Classic
        %ul
          %li Manipulates letters and digits directly
          %li Based on 'Security through obscurity'
      %li
        Modern
        %ul
          %li Operates on binary seqences
          %li Relies on publicly known mathematical algorithms and computational difficulty
  %section
    %h3 Security of Cryptography
    %p Cryptography provides four services:
    %ol
      %li Confidentiality - protects your information from an unauthorized person
      %li Data Integrity - determines if your message/communication has been tampered with
      %li Authentication - confirms that a message was sent by a known and verified sender
      %li Non-repudiation - ensures an entity cannot refuse ownership of a previous action
  %section
    %h3 Cryptography Primitives:
    %ol
      %li Encryption
      %li Hash Functions
      %li Message Authentication Codes
      %li Digital Signatures

      What is Signal?
    %p
      %a{:href => "Signal_Blue_Icon.png", :target => "_blank"}
        %img{:src => "/images/presentations/signal.png"}
    %ul
      %li Signal is a secure communication platform from Open Whisper Systems
      %li Provides a secure, easy to use alternative to calling, texting, and video chat
      %li Successor to RedPhone and TextSecure
      %li Uses data connection instead of phone network
      %li Signal seamlessly integrates with phone/SMS for the rest of your contacts
  %section
    %h3
      How do I use Signal to communicate?
    %img{:src => "/images/presentations/signal-conversation-list.png"}
  %section
    %h3
      How do I use Signal to communicate?
    %ul
      %li Instead of calling your contact, try a Signal voice call
      %li Instead of sending a text message, send it with Signal. Group chat is supported as well
      %li You can also video chat (no FaceTime, Allo)
      %li You can still share pictures and other media
      %li For contacts without Signal, fallback to the phone network
      %li Invite your friends to use Signal too!
  %section
    %h3
      How does Signal protect my communications?
    %ul
      %li Provides end-to-end encryption and authentication for text, audio, and video chat
      %li Based on trusted crypto primitives like Curve25519, AES-256, and HMAC-SHA256
      %li Bunch of other cool privacy features like disappearing messages, key change alerts and verification, and local message db encryption
      %li Leaves less metadata than using the phone network or other communication apps
  %section
    %h3
      Where can I get Signal?
    %ul
      %li Signal is available for mobile in the Google Play store and the Apple App Store
      %li After installing, set Signal as your default SMS application for ease of use
      %li Signal is also available for desktop as a Chrome app
%section
  %section
    %h2 TLS
  %section
    %h3 HTTPS Everywhere
    %ul
      %li Plugin for web browsers
      %li Tries to force your browser to request web resources over HTTPS
      %li Available for Chrome, Firefox and Opera
  %section
    %h3 Let's Encrypt
    %ol
      %li Project to grant free Domain Verified (DV) SSL certificates
      %li Free, automated and open source Certificate Authority (CA)
      %li Operated by the non-profit Internet Security Research Group (ISRG)
  %section
    %h3 Let's Encrypt Cont.
    %ul
      %li Free: Anyone who owns a domain name can use Letâ€™s Encrypt to obtain a trusted certificate at no cost
      %li Automatic: Certbot handles creating, installing and renewing the certificate
      %li Transparent: All certificates issued or revoked are available to the public
      %li Secure: Promotes TLS security best practices
      %li https://letsencrypt.org/
  %section
    %h3 Certbot
    %ul
      %li Automatic client which fetches and deploys SSL certificates for your web server
      %li Configures the web server to SSL using best practices
      %li "Aims to build a network that is more structurally private, safe, and protected against censorship."
      %li Free
      %li https://certbot.eff.org/
  %section
    %h3 Transport Layer Security
    %p (AKA Secure Sockets Layer)
  %section
    %h3 What is it?
    %ul
      %li Protocol used for secure electronic communications
      %li Designed to prevent eavesdropping and tampering
      %li Used in many applications such as web browsing, email and text-messaging
      %li Practical form of public key cryptography
      %li Also referred to as "Secure Sockets Layer" or "SSL"
  %section
    %h3 Why Do We Need it?
    %ul
      %li Very important information is stored electronically
      %li Much of this information is accessible from the web
      %li Without the proper protections, this information can be gathered by bad people to use for nefarious acts
  %section
    %h3 How Does it Work?
    %ul
      %li The communication between two devices is encrypted using a shared secret
      %li The shared secret is only known to the devices communicating
      %li Each message received is decrypted using a code known only to the receiver
  %section
    %h3 Best Practices
    %ul
      %li Do not browse websites which don't have valid SSL certificates
      %li Use more technology which was developed with security in mind
      %li Do not use any versions of the SSL protocol, use TLS instead (preferably TLSv1.2)
