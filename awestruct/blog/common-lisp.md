### Learning Resources

#### Books

* [Successful Lisp](https://psg.com/~dlamkins/sl/cover.html) by David Lamkins. The best resource around hands down. He is witty throughout the book and it is a joy to read. It is clear that he has spent much time teaching Common Lisp.
* [ANSI Common Lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/acl.html) by Paul Graham. The chapter on optimization is indispensible.
* [Let Over Lambda](http://www.letoverlambda.com/) by Doug Hoyte. Another witty, fun read. His examples are crystal clear and illuminating considering how abstract macros are.
* [Land Of Lisp](http://landoflisp.com/) by Conrad Barski, M.D. Aside from being hilarious it is chock full of real live code exercises to follow along with the author. Brilliant.
* [Practical Common Lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/) by Peter Seigel. The most popular and best places to begin.
* [Learn Lisp The Hard Way](http://learnlispthehardway.org/book/) by the Toronto Lisp User Group. A nice collection of hands on exercises.
* [Lisp Hackers](https://leanpub.com/lisphackers) by Vsevolod Dyomkin. An enlightening, well put together collection of interviews of famous Lisp programmers.

### Speaking Lisp

The term Programming Language to me insinuates that it can be verbally communicated to other people. For the most part this does not tend to be true. Try this: call up a friend on the phone and have them try to type in a program that you wrote and run it. It is absurdly cumbersome. I have [pointed this out before regarding mathematics](http://bennettroesch.com/efficiency.html#quare-num). How has this obvious fact been overlooked for so long?

### Lisp And Java As Compared With Honey Badgers And Venomous Snakes

There is this weird dichotomy where Lisp programmers talk all the trash about Java and Java programmers talk all the trash about Lisp. What is it about these two languages in particular? Maybe it's that they are on opposite ends of the spectrum - Lisp being the epitome of academic derived languages and Java the epitome of corporate derived languages.
