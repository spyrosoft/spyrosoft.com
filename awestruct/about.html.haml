      My profession began in 2008 as a designer using Photoshop and Illustrator. I have since moved from the top to the bottom of the developer stack. These days my greatest strength is in creating interactive web applications from the ground up with a focus on intelligent user interfaces. This means that when there is only one thing that the user could possibly want under the current conditions, it happens automatically. The interface itself is organized based on the most common user actions.
